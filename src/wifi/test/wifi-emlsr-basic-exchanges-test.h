 * @ingroup wifi-test
 * @ingroup tests
 *
 * @brief Test the transmission of DL frames to EMLSR clients.
 *
 * This test considers an AP MLD and a configurable number of non-AP MLDs that support EMLSR
 * and a configurable number of non-AP MLDs that do not support EMLSR. All MLDs have three
 * setup links, while the set of EMLSR links for the EMLSR clients is configurable.
 * Block ack agreements (for TID 0, with the AP MLD as originator) are established with all
 * the non-AP MLDs before that EMLSR clients send the EML Operating Mode Notification frame
 * to enable the EMLSR mode on their EMLSR links.
 *
 * Before enabling EMLSR mode, it is checked that:
 *
 * - all EMLSR links (but the link used for ML setup) of the EMLSR clients are considered to
 *   be in power save mode and are blocked by the AP MLD; all the other links have transitioned
 *   to active mode and are not blocked
 * - no MU-RTS Trigger Frame is sent as Initial control frame
 * - In case of EMLSR clients having no link that is not an EMLSR link and is different than
 *   the link used for ML setup, the two A-MPDUs used to trigger BA establishment are
 *   transmitted one after another on the link used for ML setup. Otherwise, the two A-MPDUs
 *   are sent concurrently on two distinct links
 *
 * After enabling EMLSR mode, it is checked that:
 *
 * - all EMLSR links of the EMLSR clients are considered to be in active mode and are not
 *   blocked by the AP MLD
 * - If all setup links are EMLSR links, the first two frame exchanges are both protected by
 *   MU-RTS TF and occur one after another. Otherwise, one frame exchange occurs on the
 *   non-EMLSR link and is not protected by MU-RTS TF; the other frame exchange occurs on an
 *   EMLSR link and is protected by MU-RTS TF
 * - the AP MLD blocks transmission on all other EMLSR links when sending an ICF to an EMLSR client
 * - After completing a frame exchange with an EMLSR client, the AP MLD can start another frame
 *   exchange with that EMLSR client within the same TXOP (after a SIFS) without sending an ICF
 * - During the transition delay, all EMLSR links are not used for DL transmissions
 * - The padding added to Initial Control frames is the largest among all the EMLSR clients
 *   solicited by the ICF
 *
 * After disabling EMLSR mode, it is checked that:
 *
 * - all EMLSR links (but the link used to exchange EML Notification frames) of the EMLSR clients
 *   are considered to be in power save mode and are blocked by the AP MLD
 * - an MU-RTS Trigger Frame is sent by the AP MLD as ICF for sending the EML Notification
 *   response, unless the link used to exchange EML Notification frames is a non-EMLSR link
 * - no MU-RTS Trigger Frame is used as ICF for QoS data frames
 * - In case of EMLSR clients having no link that is not an EMLSR link and is different than
 *   the link used to exchange EML Notification frames, the two A-MPDUs are transmitted one
 *   after another on the link used to exchange EML Notification frames. Otherwise, the two
 *   A-MPDUs are sent concurrently on two distinct links
 *
 * Also, if the PutAuxPhyToSleep attribute is set to true, it is checked that aux PHYs are in
 * sleep mode after receiving an ICF and are resumed from sleep after receiving the CF-End frame.

 * @ingroup wifi-test

 *
 * @brief Test the transmission of UL frames from EMLSR clients.
 *
 * This test considers an AP MLD and a non-AP MLD that support EMLSR. The non-AP MLD setups three
 * links, while the set of EMLSR links is configurable. Block ack agreements (for TID 0) for both
 * DL and UL directions are established after that the EML Operating Mode Notification frames are
 * exchanged to enable the EMLSR mode on the EMLSR links. Aux PHYs on the EMLSR client do not
 * switch link, hence the main PHY will switch link (if needed) when terminating a TXOP.
 *
 * It is checked that:
 *
 * - Initially, aux PHYs are configured so that they are unable to transmit frames. Before
 *   generating the packets for the first UL data frame, transmissions on the link where the
 *   main PHY is operating and on the non-EMLSR link (if any) are blocked. Thus, the first UL data
 *   frame is held until transmissions on the link where the main PHY is operating are unblocked.
 *   The first UL data frame is sent by the main PHY without RTS protection. When the data frame
 *   exchange terminates, the MediumSyncDelay timer is started on the other EMLSR links and the
 *   CCA ED threshold is set as expected
 * - If there is a non-EMLSR link, another data frame can be sent concurrently (without protection)
 *   on the non-EMLSR link
 * - When the first UL data frame is transmitted, we make the aux PHYs on the EMLSR client capable
 *   of transmitting, we block transmissions on the link where the main PHY is operating and
 *   generate new UL packets, which will then be transmitted on a link where an aux PHY is
 *   operating. Thus, the aux PHY transmits an RTS frame and the main PHY will take over and
 *   transmit the second UL data frame. We check that, while the link on which the main PHY was
 *   operating is blocked because another EMLSR link is being used, new backoff values for that
 *   link are generated if and only if the QosTxop::GenerateBackoffIfTxopWithoutTx attribute is
 *   true; otherwise, a new backoff value is generated when the link is unblocked.
 * - When the exchange of the second UL data frame terminates, we make the aux PHY unable to
 *   transmit, block transmissions on the non-EMLSR link (if any) and generate some more UL
 *   packets, which will then be transmitted by the main PHY. However, a MediumSyncDelay timer
 *   is now running on the link where the main PHY is operating, hence transmissions are protected
 *   by an RTS frame. We install a post reception error model on the AP MLD so that all RTS frames
 *   sent by the EMLSR client are not received by the AP MLD. We check that the EMLSR client makes
 *   at most the configured max number of transmission attempts and that another UL data frame is
 *   sent once the MediumSyncDelay timer is expired. We also check that the TX width of the RTS
 *   frames and the UL data frame equal the channel width used by the main PHY.
 * - We check that no issue arises in case an aux PHY sends an RTS frame but the CTS response is
 *   not transmitted successfully. Specifically, we check that the main PHY is completing the
 *   channel switch when the (unsuccessful) reception of the CTS ends and that a new RTS/CTS
 *   exchange is carried out to protect the transmission of the last data frame.
 * - While the main PHY is operating on the same link as an aux PHY (which does not switch
 *   channel), the aux PHY is put in sleep mode as soon as the main PHY starts operating on the
 *   link, stays in sleep mode until the TXOP ends and is resumed from sleep mode right after the
 *   end of the DL/UL TXOP.
 *
 * Also, if the PutAuxPhyToSleep attribute is set to true, it is checked that aux PHYs are in
 * sleep mode a SIFS after receiving the ICF and are still in sleep mode right before receiving
 * a Block Ack frame, and they are resumed from sleep after receiving the Block Ack frame.
